# EX 17 C Program to copy a  string  into another string without using strcpy() ,and find the total number of words in a given strings using for loop.
## AIM:
To write a C Program to copy a  string  into another string without using strcpy() ,and find the total number of words in a given strings using for loop.

## Algorithm
1. Read the input string from the user.
2. Copy each character from the input string to another string using a for loop until the null character is reached.
3. Count the total number of characters in the string (excluding newline if present).
4. Null-terminate the copied string.
5. Print the copied string and the total character count.


## Program:

   scanf("%[^\n]",S2);
   for(i=0;S1[i]!='\0';i++)
   {
       S2[i]=S1[i];
   }
   S2[i]='\0';
   printf("s2:%s",S2);
   for(j=0;S2[j]!='\0';j++)
   {
       c++;
   }
   printf("\nTotal words=%d",c);
